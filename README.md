# Kyrsha's App (React Native + Expo)
I built this app for a friend who wanted to have their own app for daily quotes, information, and inspiration. 
I used React Native and Expo. I am no product designer, so I know the UI could look better. The app is using a 
third party API to retrieve the random content.
